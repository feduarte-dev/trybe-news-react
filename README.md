## Project Gist

Check out [this link](https://gist.github.com/feduarte-dev/fdeed18cce3fc52fbf74e299b370923a).

## Responsiveness

This project was carefully designed to adapt to different screen resolutions, ensuring a great user experience across devices. I considered the following reference resolutions:

* **Mobile Devices**: Optimized for 360 x 800 resolution, one of the most widely used worldwide, making the app enjoyable on smartphones.
* **Desktops**: Built for 1366 x 768 resolution, the second most common among PC users. While 1920 x 1080 is the most common, I chose to optimize for a smaller resolution to make the app more inclusive.

This responsive design approach aims to serve most users regardless of their device, ensuring a consistent and satisfying experience.

## Redux vs Context

For state management, I chose **Context** instead of **Redux**. Considering the project’s size and scope, Context provided a simpler and more effective solution, avoiding the added complexity of Redux. It allowed clean and efficient data sharing across components while keeping the code organized and easy to maintain.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages a variety of modern tools and technologies to deliver a great user experience:

* **React**: Widely used JavaScript library for building interactive UIs.
* **Vite**: Fast and efficient front-end build tool.
* **RTL (React Testing Library)**: Essential for effectively testing React components.
* **Bootstrap**: Popular CSS framework for fast UI design.
* **Infinite Scroll**: Component to render more items dynamically as the user scrolls.
* **Figma**: Collaborative UI design tool used to bring the project to life.
* **Context API**: Native React solution for sharing data across components.
* **CSS**: Styling language for web pages.
* **TypeScript**: JavaScript superset that adds static typing and advanced features.
* **ESLint**: Linting tool to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Additional Features

In addition to the features requested in the Project Gist, I enhanced the user experience with the following:

* **Image Carousel**: Added a carousel to highlight featured content, making the page more dynamic and engaging.
* **Infinite Scrolling**: Eliminated the need to click buttons to load more news — users can simply scroll for more content.
* **Light & Dark Mode**: Provided theme switching for improved user interaction and customization.
* **Back to Top Button**: Added a button to quickly return to the top of the page.

Quer que eu deixe esse README mais **clean e resumido** (estilo de projetos open-source no GitHub) ou prefere manter esse formato bem **detalhado e explicativo**?
